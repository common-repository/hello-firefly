== Description ==

Hello Firefly buils on the work that Matt Mulenweg did with the 'Hello Dolly' plugin.  I am not a huge Hello Dolly fan (though I designed the lights at a community theater's version of it many years ago and don't remember hating it or anything) but I am a huge fan of the television series Firefly. I thought what would really be cool every time I had to login to wordpress and fix something some Shee-niou editor did that broke the site wass if I'd see some line from the show so I could enjoy a laugh and get shiny again.  So I edited a little bit and came up with Hello Firefly.  I added it to a few blogs I managed for a couple of companies and the tech people kept seeing it and asking when I would release it.  So, here it is, so you too can enjoy it.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hello-firefly.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Firefly/Serenity? =

Only the finest TV show ever, that Fox screwed up and cancelled after one amazing season.  Go here and get it if you don't own it.   http://goo.gl/QaYFW1

= Why did Fox cancel such an amazing show? =

Because Fox couldn't tell an amazing show from FAY-FAY duh PEE-yen.

= Did you write this plugin? =

Well, I kind of more or less modifed an existing one to suit my needs.  The gorram genius that created the original is the man they call Matt Mullenweg.  This plugin is a fork of that one.  

= Thanks for your work making this plugin.  Can I buy you a mudder's milk?? =

I'd love to say "I don't drink coffee.  Buy me a mudder's milk" but that stuf actually sounds gross.  I'm more of a diet coke fan myself.  If you feel so inclined, feel free to send a buck or two at https://www.paypal.me/hellofirefly
